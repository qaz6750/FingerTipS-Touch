# Focal Tech Touch 5x Controller Driver for Windows
In this repository you can find the Focal Tech Touch 5x controller driver for Windows (KMDF).
This driver supports Focal Tech 5x touch controllers.

This repository has been forked from https://github.com/theR4K/SynapticsTouch for the base and modified to work with Focal Tech digitizers.

## Disclaimer
This driver is not finished.
It contains debug code and might be missing comments as well.
Tracing has been replaced with KdPrintEx for various reason making development easier on some versions of Windows.

Have fun =)
